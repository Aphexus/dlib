dlib
====
dlib is a growing collection of native D language libraries useful for various higher-level projects - such as game engines, rendering pipelines and multimedia applications. 
It is written in D2 and has no external dependencies aside D's standard library, Phobos.

Currently dlib contains the following packages:

* dlib.core - standard algorithms, data structures, useful templates, etc.

* dlib.functional - some functional programming idioms (HOFs, combiners, quantifiers, etc.)

* dlib.math - linear algebra (vectors, matrices, quaternions, etc.)

* dlib.geometry - computational geometry (ray casting, primitives, intersection, etc.)

* dlib.image - image processing (filters, color correction, FFT, graphics formats I/O, support for 8 and 16-bit RGBA buffers and floating point operations)

* dlib.xml - lightweight XML parser (only reaing, only Unicode)
